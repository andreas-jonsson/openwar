### About

OpenWar is an alternative Warcraft: Orcs & Humans game engine. So unless you have a *legal copy* of Warcraft: Orcs & Humans (original MS-DOS version required, won't work with the Mac or Demo versions) OpenWar will be pretty useless to you, since it doesn't come with any graphics or sounds itself.

Since OpenWar is a different game engine, not all things will work 100% the same as they did in the original Warcraft, if you want the original unchanged Warcraft experience, you will still have to use the original game.
